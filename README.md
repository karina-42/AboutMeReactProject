## Introduction
Inspired by a [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) React tutorial, I decided to try my hand at making a little get-to-know-me landing page, including links to my social media.

## Technologies
* React
* Vite
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Lessons learned
I learned how to use Vite to set up and develop a React app quickly. I learned how to separate my app into components and how into import and export the data through different files. I also learned how to use Font Awesome properly within a React app. I wanted to use different languages in my site, so I learned how to handle different languages in the HTML for better user experience.

## Improvements
- [ ] Have translations of each sentence appear on hover.
